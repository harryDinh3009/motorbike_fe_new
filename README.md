# Getting Started with Vite React TypeScript

This project is bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and uses React with TypeScript.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run preview`

Preview the production build locally.\
This command starts a local server to serve the built app.
